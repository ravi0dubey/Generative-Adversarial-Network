# Generative-Adversarial-Network

 1. Input size is 32 * 32 *3 as cifar dataset is 32 *32 *3  </br>
 2. LeakyRelu works better for GAN instead of Relu </br>
 3. Since the output of Discriminator is binary(1,0) hence we have used sigmoid activation </br>
 4. Compile the model with learning_rate as .0002 with adam optimizer </br>
